    <p class="about">
      <i>“I just want to be alright. It’s hard to be ‘okay’ when you’ve seen so much. I saw my city die; I saw my people perish; I saw myself break. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay but I want that.”</i> - Sami, a 29-year-old who fled Aleppo for Damascus, then Beirut, Lebanon

      The critical issue of the ongoing expansion of urban warfare is a trend anticipated to persist alongside the continual growth of urban populations. While acknowledging the inevitability of warfare, we emphasize the need to illuminate its extensive consequences, especially on civilians. Urban warfare forces individuals to abandon their homes, resulting in enduring displacement even after the conflict ceases. The increasing urbanization trend necessitates heightened awareness of the profound impact of warfare on displaced populations and urban environments. Civilians actively become entangled in the conflict, enduring extended periods of deprivation and grappling with the challenges of siege warfare. Exposure to the aftermath of conflict, coupled with lingering spoils of war, often contributes to the emergence of terrorist organizations. The persistent trauma experienced by civilians reaches an unbearable intensity, underscoring the urgent need to address the enduring consequences of warfare on civilian populations. Furthermore, this review explores preventive measures and strategies to maintain human dignity amidst warfare. By delving into potential solutions, the paper seeks to contribute to a discourse on mitigating the detrimental effects of urban warfare and preserving the well-being and dignity of individuals caught in its midst.

    <h1 class="header">Worse Than Death</h1>
    <p class="about">
      Whatever wrong a person can do, either genocide or something else, does not matter the intensity. The worse thee can get is capital punishment, aka K.O., aka death. Is not dying an incentive enough not to be a wrongdoer? Can a punishment more severe than death solve this issue or even exist?
